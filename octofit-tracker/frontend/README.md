# OctoFit Tracker Frontend

React 19 presentation tier for the OctoFit Tracker multi-tier application.

## Environment

Define `VITE_CODESPACE_NAME` when running in GitHub Codespaces so the frontend can call the backend through the forwarded public URL.

Example `.env.local`:

```text
VITE_CODESPACE_NAME=your-codespace-name
```

When `VITE_CODESPACE_NAME` is set, API calls use:

```text
https://$VITE_CODESPACE_NAME-8000.app.github.dev/api/[component]/
```

When it is unset, the app safely falls back to:

```text
http://localhost:8000/api/[component]/
```
